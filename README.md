RAG

rag is a game where you have to fight to survive between two great ancient powers.

v1 basic movements and heightmaps for point to click movement

v2 interactable's put in place, so far there are three but it is modular and very easy to add more. 
   so far I have the base interaction which lets the game know the player is doing something, but what? thats what the child derivitives are for.
   I have action for turning on a light or opening a door, I added ITEM interaction for when a player is going to loot a sword or lootable item, I added NPC for if a player is to converse with an NPC of any kind ( I can very easily create hostile and friendly derivitaves stemming from the NPC)  and finally I added READ for when a player is reading a sign or something like that.

   the interactbles let me know exactly what the player is interacting with so I can set up correct UI's to follow up with the action.

   also made it so the player does not run exactly to the interacted object but rather a litle bit in front.
